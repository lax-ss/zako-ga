# g/ISA
this is an upcoming computer virus of mine that tests your antivirus, similarly to how infinite soulabyss tests the strength of your characters.
beware of layer 8 because it can kill your whole pc, not just the boot sector.
this was originally a yagwick virus however uhhh im too lazy to render yagwick and infinite soulabyss would be alot easier
when this is finished uhhhhhhhhhhhhhh idk what you would want to do with this except destroying your school computers
run at your own risk.
there will be a few prompts telling you that this is not a fake virus, this is probably one of the most harmful viruses you could have when this is finished
unlike the roblox ISA there is no stopscript so once you run this you're doomed basically
no files yet!
ok baiiii
